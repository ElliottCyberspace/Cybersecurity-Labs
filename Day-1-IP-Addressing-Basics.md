Introduction to IP Addressing (IPv4, IPv6, subnetting basics)



\## 📝 Notes

\- IP address = unique device identifier on a network.  

\- IPv4 (32-bit) vs IPv6 (128-bit).  

\- Structure: Network ID + Host ID, determined by subnet mask.  

\- Private ranges: 10.x.x.x, 172.16–31.x.x, 192.168.x.x.  

\- Subnetting divides networks into smaller ones.  

\- Commands: `ipconfig` (Windows), `ifconfig` / `ip addr` (Linux/Mac).

\## ✅ What I Learned

\- Difference between public \& private IP.  

\- IPv6 exists because IPv4 ran out of addresses.  

\- Subnetting makes networks scalable.
